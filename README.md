# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
An analysis of Kickstarter campaign data to examine trends. Focusing primarily on the parent category of "theater" campaigns, and subcategory of "plays".

### Purpose
Provide client with an overwiew and analysis of their campaign funding. Specifically, the correlation of campaigns outcomes (success/fail) in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
Overall analysis consisted of 4114 campaigns totaled, from the years of 2009 to 2017. Data from the campaign was filtered to focus on the parent category of 'theater' projects, which totaled 1393 projects. The data was further filtered to projects listed as 'plays', which totaled 1066 projects. 

Analysis was then started for comparison between Successful, Failed, and Canceled projects. Outcomes will be determined using data based on launch data and goal data. 

Only minor challenges were encountered. When using the PivotTables and Chart I assigned the wrong values for the pivot table fields or I wrote formulas incorrectly by forgetting certain elements or typos. Just had to double check and play around with the function of the graphs til I got it right. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the data, it suggests that the months of May and June will have the most chance for success, while the months of January and December are least likely for success. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the data, projects with a funding goal of less than $5000 are rated higher for successful funding. While projects with the funding goal between $10,000 to $20,00 have about a 50% chance of successful funding. Any project with a funding goal greater than $20,000 tend to be failed campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Only minor challenges were encountered. When using the formulas in charts I assigned the wrong values for the functions. Just had to double check and play around with the equation/function  til I got it right.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  One conclusion that can be drawn about the outcomes based on Launch Date is that more successful funding happens in the month of May and June. Another conclusion that can be drawn based on the Launch Date is that the months of January and December have lower chance of successful funding. Louise should begin campaigning around the month of May/June. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

  Based on the funding goals, the data supports the theory that projects with funding goals less than $15000 have a 50% or higher chance of successul funding. If a campaign has a goal of $20,000 or more, they are less liekly to have successul funding. Louise should have good chance of a successfull funding if her funding goal is $10,000 or less. 
 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

  Some limitations of the dataset would be not taking into account other socioeconomic factors that could affect the outcome. Other limitations could be popularity, access, and bias. All three of these factors play a role in how people will view the topic or hear about it. Some countries might be aware of certain plays more than others. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

  Another possible table/graph that could be created based on the campaign length and how it correlates to funding, with this Louise can see if the length of the campaign effects funding. Another table/graph based on campaign spotlights and outcomes to show how advertising can effect funding.
